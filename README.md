# React Projects

This repository contains some of the projects I've worked on in React (v16.8), Redux, and possibly React Native as I learn to look back at for reference and track my progress.

Projects
--------

1.  **jsx-intro** - This is very simple "sandbox" app that introduced me to basic JSX syntax.
2.  **seasons-site** - Displays the season based on user's geolocation
3.  **blog-post** - Generic blog posts using data from the faker.js library.
4.  **api_pics** - Image search engine that retrieves images from unsplash api and displays them in a grid layout.
5.  **api_videos** - Video search engine that uses Google's YouTube api to display a list of videos and a selected video player.
6. **redux-song-list** - Generic react-redux app that uses redux store to store a list of songs/song data.
7.  **markdown-editor** - Markdown editor that transforms markdown syntax
8. **random-quran** - Single page website that fetches a random ayah from a Quran API and displays it along with the surah name.
9. **blog** - Using redux-thunk middleware, fetching blog posts/users from api to organize a blog site.
10. **streams** - Twitch-like streaming service that allows users to create, delete, and view streams.
